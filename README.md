##### Team Name: Eastern Eagles
##### Group Number: 3

Welcome to the Eastern Eagles' project on finding the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh to raise a family! Our team, consisting of Abdulrahman Alhazmi and Shihab Alzakwani, has conducted an in-depth analysis of various factors to identify the most family-friendly neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

### Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide valuable insights to families looking for an ideal neighborhood in Pittsburgh to settle down and raise their children. By considering multiple criteria, our team aims to identify a neighborhood that offers a safe and conducive environment for families, with access to essential amenities, good schools, recreational activities, and a strong sense of community.

### Project Methodology
Our team has followed a systematic approach to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh to raise a family. We have collected and analyzed data from various sources, including official city records, census data, real estate listings, and online resources. Our methodology included the following steps:

**Data Collection:** We gathered data on key factors that are important for families, such as crime rates, school rankings, proximity to parks and playgrounds, affordability, and accessibility to public transportation.

**Data Analysis:** We performed thorough data analysis using statistical tools and techniques to compare and rank different neighborhoods based on the collected data. We assigned weights to different factors based on their relative importance to families.

**Visualization:** We presented our findings through graphical visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, to make it easy for families to understand and compare different neighborhoods.

**Final Ranking:** Based on the analysis and visualization of data, we arrived at a final ranking of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, identifying the best neighborhood for families to raise their children.
